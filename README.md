## Background

This project comes from the topic provided by AOSC researchers. At present, there are a considerable number of Linux and other open source or free software (F/OSS) users in China. However, in the process of using, it is not difficult for users to find that the quality of simplified Chinese translation and localization of various software is uneven, and there are many errors and omissions. In order to improve user experience in China, this project will realize the translation of GNOME based on GNU/LINUX programming environment.
